                                                General Approach
                                                                                                                              
We held a sprint planning meeting in which we discussed the needed deliverables for our application. We discussed best practices as well as our own expectations while pair programing.
With those deliverables in mind we went to Pivotal Tracker and developed epics and user stories. As we agreed that we would pair program (using one computer at a time – both contributing to every line of code) we were both owners (responsible) for the tasks assigned to each user story. We discussed and agreed on a general timeline of task completion and began to work. Starting first with our ERD diagram (linked below) and by setting up our Spring project.


                                     Technologies used
1. Git – local repository
2. Github – remote repository
3. Java
4. Spring
5. Maven
5. Hibernate
6. PostgresSQL
7. Mockito - JUnit
8. Draw.io - ERD diagram

10. Postman – test / verify API calls
11. Eclipse / IntelliJ



                         Challenges / areas of opportunity 

1. connecting to frontend application
2. Using Mockito to test each layer
3. 


                     
                                Successes / What went well 

1. open and honest communication
2. pair programing
3. we balanced each other (strengths / weeknesses)
4. over 70% test coverage on entire application (including config package)
